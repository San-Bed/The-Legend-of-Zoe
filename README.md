# Legend-of-Zoe
A little command-line videogame built for my IFT 1025 - Programming II course. The game was developed with the help of my colleague and friend, Justin Michaud.

# What I Learned
* Developed a user interface within the xml file using RelativeLayout, ListView, EditText, & Button.
* Implemented functinality to the UI: onCreate, onAddItem, setupListViewListener, readItems, & writeItems.
* Integrated setOnItemLongClickListener to remove items from the list.
