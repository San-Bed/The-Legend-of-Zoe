# Legend-of-Zoe
This is a little command-line game inspired by The Legend of Zelda and Roguelike games. You play Zoe, Zelda's cousin, who must go in search of the Hexaforce's pieces to restore order to the world. Zoe advances through the 6 levels of a dungeon, each level hides one of the pieces of Hexaforce. The game with the help of my colleague and friend, Justin Michaud.
