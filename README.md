# Legend-of-Zoe
This is a little command-line game inspired by The Legend of Zelda. You play Zoe, who must go in search of the Hexaforce's pieces to restore order to the world. The game was developed with the help of my colleague and friend, Justin Michaud.

# What I Learned
* Developed a user interface within the xml file using RelativeLayout, ListView, EditText, & Button.
* Implemented functinality to the UI: onCreate, onAddItem, setupListViewListener, readItems, & writeItems.
* Integrated setOnItemLongClickListener to remove items from the list.
